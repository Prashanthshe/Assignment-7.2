Session 7 – Basic Statistics
Assignment 7.2

1.Write a program to create barplots for all the categorical columns in mtcars.
> freq = table(mtcars$gear)
> barplot(freq, main = "Frequency by number of gears", xlab = "Number of Gears", ylab="Frequency")
> 
2.Create a scatterplot matrix by gear types in mtcars dataset.
> plot(mtcars$gear , mtcars$mpg, xlab = 'Number of gears', ylab = 'mpg',  main = 'Number of gears Vs mpg')

3.Write a program to create a plot density by class variable.
> d <- density(mtcars$mpg)
> plot(d)
